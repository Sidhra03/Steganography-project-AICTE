# Steganography-project-AICTE
Project Title:- Secure Data Hiding in images using Steganography.
In this Project I have used Python 3.13 (64 bit), cv2 libraries, os libraries and string libraries.
Requirements: For executing this code you need to download and install Python in your, also you need to install cv2 libraries for which you can use the code pip install cv2 (paste this code in the command prompt). These requirements are necessary to run this code and execute it.
About the project: This project highlights the importance of data hiding and steganography. In this project, through the python code encryption and decryption of the message is done and the encrypted image is generated which has the data or the secret message hidden in it.
When we run the code it asks us to Enter a scret message, after that it asks us to enter a passcode after that the encrypted image which has the scret message hidden in it appears, the nest step is that it asks for the decryption code and on entering the decryption code the scret message is revealed.
